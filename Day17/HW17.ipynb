    "### Homework Day 17\n",
    "\n",
    "This homework has two parts. You are going to do a regression analysis and a classificationn analysis using decision trees.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Using the Iris data - same data as we saw at the end of lecture:\n",
    "   \n",
    "- Fit a DecisionTreeClassifier to the training data.\n",
    "- Evaluate accuracy on the testing data.\n",
    "- Explore the effect of tree depth.\n",
    "- Visualize the tree (limit depth if needed).\n",
    "- Investigate feature importance:\n",
    "    - Which features are most important for classification?\n",
    "    - Does pruning or limiting depth change feature importance?\n",
    "      \n",
    "Hint:\n",
    "*cls_tree.feature_importances_ gives the importance of each feature after fitting.*\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Using the California Housing data:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Fit a DecisionTreeRegressor to the training data.\n",
    "- Evaluate train and test MSE.\n",
    "- Explore pruning using cost-complexity pruning.\n",
    "- Visualize the tree (limit depth if needed).\n",
    "- Investigate feature importance:\n",
    "    - Which features are most important for splitting?\n",
    "    - How does pruning affect feature importance?\n",
    "\n",
    "Hint:\n",
    "*reg_tree.feature_importances_ gives the importance of each feature after fitting.*\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Some things to consider:\n",
    "- How  does pruning or limiting tree depth affects train/test error?\n",
    "- How does feature importance changes with pruning or depth constraints.\n",
    "- What are the trade-offs between overfitting and underfitting.\n",
    "- Visualization of tree structure for insight.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Optional:**\n",
    "- For the classification tree, reduce to two features and plot decision boundaries.\n",
    "- For the regression tree, plot predictions for a single feature to see the behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Please write up your conclusions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Your final notebooks should:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- [ ] Be a completely new notebook.\n",
    "- [ ] **Contain the answers to the questions above along with code that supports your conclusions.**\n",
    "- [ ] Be reproducible with junk code removed.\n",
    "- [ ] Have lots of language describing what you are doing, especially for questions you are asking or things that you find interesting about the data. Use complete sentences, nice headings, and good markdown formatting: https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/\n",
    "- [ ] It should run without errors from start to finish."
